PCA- Data Reduction Technique

Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets
PCA is a technique that takes a set of correlated variables and linearly transforms those variables into a set of uncorrelated factors.

principal component analysis is a method of extracting important variables (in form of components) from a large set of variables available in a data set. 
A principal component is a normalized linear combination of the original predictors in a data set.

PC¹ = Φ¹¹X¹ + Φ²¹X² + Φ³¹X³ + .... +Φp¹Xp
Φ=loading weight
X=variables/normalized predictors. Normalized predictors have mean equals to zero and standard deviation equals to one
